# The console

`ae console [session] [--follow] [--all]` is the human's lane of one session
as text: what the lead pair said to you and what it needs from you. It is a
labelled **preview of data ae already keeps**: it never submits, answers or
writes an event, and every field passes the board's terminal renderer.

## What it shows

- **Pane turns** of both lead-pair seats, from their transcripts, as
  `<seat> pane (transcript)` (` · prior n` for a recorded predecessor).
  Workers are not mirrored; an ae-injected turn never renders as one.
- **Chat-bridge asks and replies** (`telegram:` / `discord:`), every thread
  with its target named. A reply is the journal's 600-character summary,
  tagged `preview (600-char summary)`.
- **`say` lines** as `said <seat>` (or `ae` for ae's own notices); a worker's
  is counted in a coverage row, never shown.
- **Decision cards**: a lead-pair seat's CURRENT `waiting-user` declaration as
  `DECISION <seat>`, the watchdog's `human-prompt` as `NEEDS YOU <seat>`.
  `--follow` prints `-- closed: …` when one stops standing.
- **Coverage rows** for anything it cannot read: a torn or absent transcript,
  an unsupported harness, an unreadable journal, skipped journal lines.
- `--all` adds the lead pair's assistant replies.

## Keys

`prefix h` opens (or returns from) a `console` window running
`ae console <session> --follow`; `prefix H` jumps to the lead pane. The window
is stamped `@ae_console` (the session uuid), never `@ae_agent`, so the watchdog
reads no agent in it. `remain-on-exit` keeps a console that stopped following
(a renamed or replaced session) on screen with its reopen hint; `prefix h`
respawns it. Residual: a card can outlive input typed in its pane, because
only the watchdog daemon ends a wait on pane input.
